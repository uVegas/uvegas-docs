# Basic Configuration

uVegas is designed to be **highly modular and customizable**. Each game component comes with its **own configuration**, allowing you to adjust behavior without modifying core scripts.

Examples include:

* **BlackjackDealer** â€“ Configure dealer behavior, card dealing speed, and rules.
* **PokerTable** â€“ Adjust table limits, blinds, and player interaction settings.
* **RouletteTable** â€“ Set wheel type, bet limits, and payout rules.
* **SlotMachine** â€“ Define symbols, paylines, and jackpot probabilities.

In addition to component-level settings, uVegas provides **global game settings** that apply across all assets:

* Game styles and variants
* Table rules and limits
* Card designs and deck variations
* Chips, tokens, and visual styles

All configuration options can be modified at any time in the Unity Editor. Detailed documentation for each setting is available in the **component-specific docs** for each game (Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, Slots).

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** For quick testing, use the default configurations provided in each asset. You can create multiple presets for different gameplay styles and switch between them at runtime.
