# Integration & Extensibility

{% hint style="danger" %}
This asset is currently in development and will be available in 2026.
{% endhint %}

The framework includes a modular integration layer designed to work seamlessly with [Unity Cloud Services](https://unity.com/products/unity-cloud) and [Unity Ads](https://unity.com/de/products/unity-ads).&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
The underlying layer of interfaces and base classes makes it easy to extend or replace these systems with other backends such as [PlayFab](https://playfab.com/), [Nakama](https://heroiclabs.com/nakama/) or [AdMob](https://admob.google.com/intl/de/home/).
{% endhint %}

Currently, integrations for the following features are in active development:

* **Authentication** – Login via Device ID or Username/Password
* **Economy** – Manage player chips using Economy
* **Leaderboards** – Track player stats and rankings through Leaderboards
* **Payment / Ads** – Enable in-app purchases or rewarded ads for chip acquisition

Once completed, this package will be released as an **extension** on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/). For release updates, you can subscribe to our newsletter [on our website](https://uvegas.online/).
