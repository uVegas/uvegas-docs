# Introduction

uVegas is a collection of premium Unity assets designed to deliver authentic online casino experiences. Each game - Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, and Slot Machines - is available as a **modular asset**, allowing developers to integrate them into their projects **independently** or in combination.

The modular system ensures that once a game is added to your project, it automatically connects to uVegas' **dedicated multiplayer server architecture**. Players can join tables for any game without additional configuration in Unity, making setup effortless and seamless.

Whether you start with Blackjack and later add Poker, or expand to Roulette and Slot Machines, uVegas handles **server-side table creation, matchmaking, and client synchronization** automatically. This approach focuses on:

* **Scalability:** Hundreds of players can play simultaneously without performance drops.
* **Security:** Server-authoritative architecture prevents client-side manipulation.
* **Ease of Integration:** Drop-in prefabs and clear documentation allow fast setup.
* **Cross-Platform Support:** Fully optimized for desktop and mobile platforms.

With uVegas, developers can quickly build fully-featured online casino experiences, adding new games over time while maintaining a **stable, secure, and enjoyable multiplayer environment**.
