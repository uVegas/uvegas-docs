# BlackjackRules

### Overview

The **Blackjack Rules** component provides a fully configurable rule system for Blackjack tables in _uVegas_.\
It allows you to define all relevant gameplay parameters - from dealer behavior to payout structure - through a single **ScriptableObject**.\
These rule assets can be assigned to different table prefabs to create custom game variants (e.g., “Classic 21”, “Vegas Strip”, or “High Roller” tables).

***

### Key Features

* 🎯 **Modular Configuration** — Each table can have its own rule asset.
* 🃏 **Authentic Gameplay** — Supports traditional Blackjack conventions such as splits, double downs, insurance, and surrender.
* ⚙️ **Dynamic Adjustments** — Modify rules in the Inspector without changing code.
* 💰 **Payout Customization** — Configure winnings and insurance multipliers for various styles of play.
